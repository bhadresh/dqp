                Gmail now even more secure: HTTPS by default
              </h3>
              <p>
                HTTPS encryption keeps your mail secure as it travels between your web browser and
                Gmail servers, so someone sharing your favorite coffee shop's public wifi can't
                maliciously read it. Banks and credit card companies use this same protocol to keep
                your online accounts safe. To protect your Gmail account, we've turned on the
                option to "always use HTTPS" for everyone. This added layer of security can make
                Gmail slower, so if you don't use unencrypted wireless connections, you can choose
                to disable this option in your account <a href=
                "https://mail.google.com/mail/#settings">Settings</a>. Even if you change this
                setting, Gmail will always encrypt the login page to protect your password.

                The buttons and menus at the top of your inbox look a bit different: there's a new
                "Labels" button that makes labeling messages even easier. Turn on keyboard
                shortcuts and hit "L" to bring up your labels, and auto-complete will take it from
                there. Use the "Move to" button to label and archive in just one step -- just like
                you would with a folder. <a href=

                Gmail is usually all about speedy electronic communication, but for a limited time
                we went old school with snail mail. If you sent in a self-addressed stamped
                envelope, we'd send you some free Gmail stickers. Free stickers are no longer
                available, but you can <a href=
