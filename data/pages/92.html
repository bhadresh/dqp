  <div class="attnbox"><p><strong>Important Update:</strong> On November 19, 2009, the Court <a href="http://www.googlebooksettlement.com/05CV8136_20091119.pdf">granted</a> preliminary approval of the <a href="http://www.googlebooksettlement.com/Amended-Settlement-Agreement.zip">Amended Settlement</a>.

<h1 style="font-size:150%;margin-bottom:8px;padding-bottom:0;">The Future of Google Books</h1>
<h3 style="margin:0;border:0;">Our groundbreaking agreement with authors and publishers.</h3>
<br />
<p>Three years ago, the Authors Guild, the Association of American Publishers and a handful of authors and publishers filed a class action lawsuit against Google Books. </p>
<p>Today we're delighted to announce that we've settled that lawsuit and will be working closely with these industry partners to bring even more of the world's books online.  Together we'll accomplish far more than any of us could have individually, to the enduring benefit of authors, publishers, researchers and readers alike. </p>
<p>It will take some time for this agreement to be approved and finalized by the Court.  For now, here's a peek at the changes we hope you'll soon see.  </p>

<img src="images/01.png" class="numIcon" /><h3 id="1">Book Search today</h3>
<p>Right now, you can search over the full text of some seven million books through Google Books.  Try it out for yourself: </p>
<form method="get" action="http://books.google.com/books">
<table bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<tr>
<td><input type="hidden" name="hl" value="en" />
<input type="hidden" name="sourceid" value="books-referral-partner" />
<input type="text" name="q" size="25" maxlength="255" value="" />
<input type="submit" name="btnG" value="Search Books" /> </td>
</tr>
</table></form>
<br />
<p>Whenever you do a Google web search, you're also searching our book index; any relevant hits will appear in your search results, and clicking on a result will take you to the relevant page in the book, where you can browse a few more pages and learn where to borrow or buy it.</p>

<p>The books in Google Books come from two sources. </p>
<h4 id="1a">The Library Project </h4>
<p>We've partnered with <a href="http://www.google.com/googlebooks/partners.html">renowned libraries</a> around the world to include their collections in Book Search. For Library Project books that are still in copyright, our results are like a card catalog; we show you info about the book and, generally, a few snippets of text showing your search term in context.</p>
<p>For Library Project books that are out of copyright, however, you can read and download the entire book.</p>

</tr></table>
</center>
<p class="clear"></p>
<h4 id="1b">The Partner Program</h4>
<p>We’ve also partnered with over 20,000 publishers and authors to make their books discoverable on Google.  You can flip through a few preview pages of these books, just like you'd browse them at a bookstore or library.  You'll also see links to libraries and bookstores where you can borrow or buy the book.</p>
<p>You can learn more about, and sign up for, the Partner Program <a href="http://books.google.com/partner">here</a>.</p>
<br /><br />
<img src="images/02.png" class="numIcon" /><h3 id="2">How Book Search will change</h3>
<p>Once approved, this agreement will allow us and our publishing industry partners to greatly expand the number of books that you can find, preview and buy through Google.  Here's how. </p>
<h4 id="2a">Out of print books   </h4>
<p>Until now, we've only been able to show a few snippets of text for most of the in-copyright books we've scanned through our Library Project.  Since the vast majority of these books are out of print, to actually read them you'd have to hunt them down at a library or a used bookstore.</p>
<center>
<table><tr valign="top">
<td><a href="images.html#img6"><img src="images/snippets-digital-photograph_sm.png" class="screenshot" /></a><br /><br /><p><em>Snippet view</em></p></td>
<td><img src="images/arrow-right.png" class="screenshot" style="border:0" /></td>

<td><img src="images/arrow-right.png" class="screenshot" style="border:0" /></td>
<td><img src="images/book.gif" height="180" /><br /><br /><p><em>Paid Full View</em></p></td>
</tr></table>
</center>
<p class="clear"></p>
<p>This agreement will allow us to make many of these out-of-print books available for preview, reading and purchase in the U.S..  Helping to ensure the ongoing accessibility of out-of-print books is one of the primary reasons we began this project in the first place, and we couldn't be happier that we and our author, library and publishing partners will now be able to protect mankind's cultural history in this manner.  </p>
<h4 id="2b">Accessing books</h4>
<p>This agreement will create new options for reading entire books (which is, after all, what books are there for). </p>
<ul style="margin-left:10px;">
<li><h5>Online access </h5>
<p>Once this agreement has been approved, you'll be able to purchase full online access to millions of books.  This means you can read an entire book from any Internet-connected computer, simply by logging in to your Book Search account, and it will remain on your electronic bookshelf, so you can come back and access it whenever you want in the future.</p>
</li>
<li><h5>Library and university access</h5>
<p>We'll also be offering libraries, universities and other organizations the ability to purchase institutional subscriptions, which will give users access to the complete text of millions of titles while compensating authors and publishers for the service.  Students and researchers will have access to an electronic library that combines the collections from many of the top universities across the country. Public and university libraries in the U.S. will also be able to offer terminals where readers can access the full text of millions of out-of-print books for free.</p>
</li>
<li><h5>Buying or borrowing actual books </h5>
<p>Finally, if the book you want is available in a bookstore or nearby library, we'll continue to point you to those resources, as we've always done.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>International users</h5>
<p>Because this agreement resolves a United States lawsuit, it directly affects only those users who access Book Search in the U.S.; anywhere else, the Book Search experience won't change.  Going forward, we hope to work with international industry groups and individual rightsholders to expand the benefits of this agreement to users around the world.</p>
<br /><br />
<img src="images/03.png" class="numIcon" /><h3 id="3">Three types of books</h3>
<p>This agreement helps define how our users may access different categories of books on Google Books.  </p>
<ol style="margin-left:10px;">
<li>
<h5>In-copyright and in-print books</h5>
<p>In-print books are books that publishers are still actively selling, the ones you see at most bookstores.  This agreement expands the online marketplace for in-print books by letting authors and publishers turn on the "preview" and "purchase" models that make their titles more easily available through Book Search.</p>
</li>
<li><h5>In-copyright but out-of-print books</h5>
<p>Out-of-print books aren’t actively being published or sold, so the only way to procure one is to track it down in a library or used bookstore.  When this agreement is approved, every out-of-print book that we digitize will become available online for preview and purchase, unless its author or publisher chooses to "turn off" that title.  We believe it will be a tremendous boon to the publishing industry to enable authors and publishers to earn money from volumes they might have thought were gone forever from the marketplace.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Out-of-copyright books</h5>
<p>This agreement doesn't affect how we display out-of-copyright books; we will continue to allow Book Search users to read, download and print these titles, just as we do today.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<br /><br />
<img src="images/04.png" class="numIcon" /><h3 id="4">The Book Rights Registry</h3>
<p>The agreement will also create an independent, not-for-profit Book Rights Registry to represent authors, publishers and other rightsholders.  In essence, the Registry will help locate rightsholders and ensure that they receive the money their works earn under this agreement.  You can visit the <a href="http://books.google.com/booksrightsholders/">settlement administration site</a>, the Authors Guild or the AAP to learn more about this important initiative.</p>
<br /><br />
<img src="images/05.png" class="numIcon" /><h3 id="5">Libraries and universities</h3>
<p>This agreement wouldn't have been possible without all the libraries who have preserved these books and now partnered with us to make so many of them discoverable online.  We're delighted that this agreement creates new opportunities for libraries and universities to offer their patrons and students access to millions of books beyond their own collections.</p>
<p>In addition to the institutional subscriptions and the free public access terminals, the agreement also creates opportunities for researchers to study the millions of volumes in the Book Search index. Academics will be able to apply through an institution to run computational queries through the index without actually reading individual books.   </p>
<br /><br />
<img src="images/06.png" class="numIcon" /><h3 id="6">Looking forward</h3>
<p>&quot;Google's mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.  Today, together with the authors, publishers, and libraries, we have been able to make a great leap in this endeavor,&quot; said Sergey Brin, co-founder &amp; president of technology at Google. &quot;While this agreement is a real win-win for all of us, the real victors are all the readers.  The tremendous wealth of knowledge that lies within the books of the world will now be at their fingertips.&quot; </p>
<p>We hope and expect that this leap forward with our friends and partners in the publishing industry is just the first of many.  We love books at Google, and our fondest dream is that Book Search will evolve into a service that ensures that books, along with their authors and publishers, will flourish for many years into the future.  </p>
