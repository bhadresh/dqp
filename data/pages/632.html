Also -> I have obtained a 1915 copy of the Tsi Yuen Chinese language encyclopedia - Chinese - English. It is in 4 volumes of about 250 pages each. Would Google be interested in scanning this to make it available to everyone? I live in Sarasota, Florida. I am still searching for downloadable copies of "Golden Mirror of Medicine" (chinese medical encyclopedia of many volumes, English translation in 1880's, and the Kanghi Chinese dictionary - another Chinese Dictionary which I have been unable to find anywhere. I spend many hours of research in google and you have provided a resource of enormous value to everyone. Keep up the good work and keep scannning books.

<span class="pi">"Book Search is a godsend for genealogists, since we love nothing better than to spend hours paging through original source documents, looking for snippets of lore about our ancestors. Now we can read wills, church records, land transactions, court cases, travellers' diaries and more, in the comfort of our own homes instead of in dusty library stacks. Now if you would just put up the Documents Relating to the Colonial History of New York, and more county histories, and Quaker records, and ..... We always want more. Can you find a way to start on unpublished records buried in county courthouses? Now that would be a miracle indeed."<br />
